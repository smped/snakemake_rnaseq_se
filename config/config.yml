# Arguments passed to STAR
# sjdbOverhang should be ReadLength - 1 if you have reads < 50nt.
# Otherwise the default setting of 100 will be suitable https://groups.google.com/g/rna-star/c/x60p1C-pGbc?pli=1
# Any additional parameters to apply during indexing should be supplied using
# indexing_extra, whilst additional parameters for alignment are passed through
# align_extra
