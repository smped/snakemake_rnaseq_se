# RNA-Seq Workflow

This is an RNA-Seq workflow written in `snakemake`, and tested on the University of Adelaide HPC (phoenix).
This has been written for single end reads only and will not behave correctly for paired-end reads.

It is assumed that the reference will be obtained from [Ensembl](www.ensembl.org) and this workflow is not compatible with any other source, without further modification.

__The compilation of some qc*Rmd files currently depends on bioc-devel and these rules may misbehave until the next Bioconductor release.__
Manual compilation using `workflowr::wflow_publish('path/to/rmd', 'Commit Message')` will be effective if using `ngsReports` > 1.5.4.

## Outline

The steps currently implemented are

1. Download the DNA reference, GTF file
2. Generate the STAR index for the reference
3. Trim files using `AdapterRemoval`
4. Align Trimmed files using STAR
5. Count reads using `featureCounts`
6. Compile initial QC Rmarkdown documents using `workflowr`

Additional tasks performed are

1. Initialising a `workflowr` directory structure
2. FastQC reports are also generated for both raw and trimmed reads
3. The `rulegraph` will be generated as a dot file and a pdf

Snakemake rules rely heavily on those provided at https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers.
Version numbers for these are also available at https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/

## Essential Files

In order to run this workflow, please ensure that you have

1. Placed unprocessed fastq files in the directory `data/raw/fastq`
2. Placed a `tsv` file (usually called `samples.tsv`) in the `config` folder
    + This file **must** contain a column called `sample`
3. Edited `config.yml` in the `config folder to ensure all parameters are correct
4. An R Project file in the project root directory. This is required by `workflowr`

## Running the workflow

Once you have placed your data in `data/faw/fastq`, edited the file `samples.tsv` and checked `config/config.yml`, please run the workflow as follows:

First, activate your `snakemake` conda/mamba environment

```
micromamba activate snakemake
```

Now check you have everything correct

```
snakemake -n
```

Building the conda environments can also be helpful in advance.
This only needs to be performed once, and is quite optional.

```
snakemake --use-conda --create-envs-only
```

To run the complete workflow on phoenix, edit the script `scripts/run_snakemake.sh` with suitable resources, then:

```
sbatch scripts/run_snakemake.sh
```
